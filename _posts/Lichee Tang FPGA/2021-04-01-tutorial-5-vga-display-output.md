### VGA Display Output

VGA is an older display interface based on analog inputs of Red, Green and Blue for each pixel. The data for the pixels are changed by toggling `HSYNC` and `VSYNC` to indicate the active display area. The clock rate is defined by the resolution of the display output. A handy reference for VGA is available at [Digikey](https://www.digikey.sg/eewiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=15925278).
